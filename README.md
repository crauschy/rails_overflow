## Rails Overflow

This is a project that focuses on the "Rails" way of doing things. I plan on taking it slowly and methodically.

***
### Objectives
* Users can post questions. Other users can answer them.
* Users can comment on both questions and answers. Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
* The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
* Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
* Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.

* Stretch: Sort answers with the answer selected as the best answer first, followed by the most highly voted. Sort comments chronologically with oldest first.
* Stretch: Users can see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending".
